This document outlines the pieces of code that I used to analyze my final tracks!

1. I used trackAnalysis_depth.m to calculate some statistics in the z dimension for each track.
I also went back through a few weeks later and added a few lines to constrain lateral movement.
This script goes through each track folder, grabs the whale struct, and then calculates the statistics and 
saves them in a .mat file that I named z_stats. There is one of these files per encounter!
This file saves the max depth, min depth, the change in depth, the mean depth and std, and then the lateral distance.
Each column is for a whale in the track.

2. I used classifyDiveTypes.m to classify each track as a certain type of dive. This script grabs the z_stats
file and then adds a classification number based on the values. You can tweak the classification parameters based
off what patterns you notice in your tracks!

3. I used calc_whaleDistSpeed.m to calculate distance and speed of each whale in each encounter. This script takes the
whale and z_stats files and calculates the distance, duration, and speed between each detection. It also calculates the
total distance (not displacement!) and total speed (total track time / total track distance) for each track, then the 
average track speed and change in speed throughout the track. It saves all these values in a file called distSpd.mat,
one for each encounter.

From there, I made the track spaghetti plots (by dive class + by normalized track time), looked at group size per
encounter, and then looked for patterns between dive classification and the rest of these parameters. Most of the code
that I wrote is just a bunch of random plotting to investigate the relationship between all of these vairables, but
I can share it with you if you would like!
